## What is this app about?

This app offers interactive visualisations of vocabulary data from monolingual and bilingual children living in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Spain). This database has been collected using an online vocabulary questionnaire: the Barcelona Vocabulary Questionnaire (BVQ) which is aimed at to assessing lexical development in toddlers growing up in Catalan-Spanish bilingual environments. This questionnaire has been developed by Gonzalo Garcia-Castro, Daniela S. Avila Varela and Nuria Sebastian Galles at the Center for Brain and Cognition (Universitat Pompeu Fabra). The questionnaire was deployed using [formr](https://formr.org/), and the materials used to generate the items are available in the GitHub repository.

## Installing the R package

The accompanying R package, [`bvq`](https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq), offers an API to download, process, the data collected from the vocabulary questionnaires. This R package also contains multiple functions that extract the data and generate many metrics used frequently in the language acquisition literature to examine participantsâ€™ vocabulary or to consult acquisition norms of particular words. Documentation and working examples are available in the [package website](https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq). There are two ways of installing this package:

From [r-universe](https://gongcastro.r-universe.dev/bvq) :rocket::

```r
install.packages('bvq', repos = 'https://gongcastro.r-universe.dev')
```

From the GitHub repository:

```r
install.packages("remotes") # you may need to install remotes first
remotes::install_github("gongcastro/bvq")
```

BVQ is currently a developing package for internal use at the [Center for Brain and Cognititon](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc) (CBC). For this reason, logging in requires a password that can be required by writing to the maintainer of this package ([gongarciacastro@gmail.com](mailto:gongarciacastro@gmail.com)).
